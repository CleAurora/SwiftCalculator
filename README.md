# SwiftCalculator
This is my first calculator made with swift.  
I'm a studant of the Digital House and in ower second week of the course we recieved this dojo about making a calculator in swift with a layout near to the calculator we have on iPhone... So.. This is the result with the basic functions, the constraints, the buttons of the numbers, the equal and the A/C have the functions ok.
